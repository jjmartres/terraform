## Setup
The following guide assumes commands are run from the `local` directory.

Provide the input variables with a `variables.auto.tfvars` file which can be created from the example file provided:

```bash
cp variables.auto.tfvars.example variables.auto.tfvars
```

The values set in this file should be edited according to your environment and requirements.

Next export environment variable that will be used by Terraform!

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="$PWD/${USER}-terraform-admin.json"
export GCP_TERRAFORM_BUCKET=tfstate-gcp-bucket
export DATADOG_API_KEY=<DATADOG_API_KEY>
export DATADOG_APP_KEY=<DATADOG_APP_KEY>
export DATADOG_HOST="https://api.datadoghq.eu/"
```

Next, initialise Terraform with the name of the GCS Bucket just created:

 * bucket : the name of the GCS bucket. This name must be globally unique;
 * bucket_prefix: GCS prefix inside the bucket. Named states for workspaces are stored in an object called `<prefix>/<name>.tfstate`

```bash
terraform init -backend-config=bucket=${GCP_TERRAFORM_BUCKET} -backend-config=prefix=[BUCKET_PREFIX]
```
