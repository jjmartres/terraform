## Requirements

| Name | Version |
|------|---------|
| <a name="requirement_terraform"></a> [terraform](#requirement\_terraform) | >= 0.13 |
## Providers

| Name | Version |

| <a name="provider_google"></a> [google](#provider\_google) | n/a |
## Setup
The following guide assumes commands are run from the `local` directory.

Provide the input variables with a `variables.auto.tfvars` file which can be created from the example file provided:

```bash
cp variables.auto.tfvars.example variables.auto.tfvars
```

The values set in this file should be edited according to your environment and requirements.

Once the Cloud SDK is installed you can authenticating, set the project, and choose a compute zone with the interactive command:

```bash
gcloud init
```

Ensure the required APIs are enabled:

```bash
gcloud services enable storage-api.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable iam.googleapis.com
```

Now create a service account for Terraform to use, generate a key file for it, and save the key location as an environment variable:

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts create terraform --display-name "Terraform, Infrastructure as Code"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] --member serviceAccount:terraform@[PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com --role roles/compute.admin
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] --member serviceAccount:terraform@[PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com --role roles/storage.admin
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] --member serviceAccount:terraform@[PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com --role roles/iam.serviceAccountUser
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create terraform.json --iam-account terraform@[PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

**NOTE: Keep the key file in a safe place, and do not share or publicise it.**

Next export environment variable that wil be used by Terraform!

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="$PWD/${USER}-terraform-admin.json"
export GCP_TERRAFORM_BUCKET=tfstate-gcp-bucket
```

Next, initialise Terraform with the name of the GCS Bucket just created:

 * bucket : the name of the GCS bucket. This name must be globally unique;
 * bucket_prefix: GCS prefix inside the bucket. Named states for workspaces are stored in an object called `<prefix>/<name>.tfstate`

```bash
terraform init -backend-config=bucket=${GCP_TERRAFORM_BUCKET} -backend-config=prefix=[BUCKET_PREFIX]
```
## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| <a name="input_api_services"></a> [api\_services](#input\_api\_services) | (Optional) List of Google APIs to activate on this project | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| <a name="input_project_id"></a> [project\_id](#input\_project\_id) | (Required) The project ID. If not provided, the provider project is used | `string` | n/a | yes |
## Outputs

No outputs.
## Usage
Basic usage of this submodule is as follows:

```hcl
module "gcp_api" {
    source = "git::git@github.com:jjmartres/terraform.git//gcp/resources/api?ref=master"
    projectid = "my-project-id"
    api_services = [
      "cloudbilling.googleapis.com",
      "cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com",
      "compute.googleapis.com",
      "serviceusage.googleapis.com",
    ]
}
```
### Applying

Now that Terraform is setup check that the configuration is valid:

```bash
terraform validate 
```

To get a complete list of the different resources Terraform will create to achieve the state described in the configuration files you just wrote, run :

```bash
terraform plan
```

If the configuration is valid then apply it with:

```bash
terraform apply [-auto-approve]
```

Inspect the output of apply to ensure that what Terraform is going to do what you want, if so then enter `yes` at the prompt.
The infrastructure will then be created, this make take a some time.


### Clean Up

Remove the infrastructure created by Terraform with:

```bash
terraform destroy [-auto-approve]
rm -rf .terraform
```

Sometimes Terraform may report a failure to destroy some resources due to dependencies and timing contention.
In this case wait a few seconds and run the above command again. If it is still unable to remove everything it may be necessary to remove resources manually using the `gcloud` command or the Cloud Console.

The GCS Bucket used for Terraform state storage can be removed with:

```bash
gsutil rm -r gs://[BUCKET]
```
