## Usage
Basic usage of this submodule is as follows:

```hcl
module "gcp_subnets" {
    source = "git::git@github.com:jjmartres/terraform.git//gcp/network/subnets?ref=master"
    project   = "<PROJECT ID>"
    network_name = "example-vpc"

    subnets = [
        {
            subnet_name           = "subnet-01"
            subnet_ip             = "10.10.10.0/24"
            subnet_region         = "europe-west1"
        },
        {
            subnet_name           = "subnet-02"
            subnet_ip             = "10.10.20.0/24"
            subnet_region         = "europe-west1"
            subnet_private_access = "true"
            subnet_flow_logs      = "true"
            description           = "This subnet has a description"
        },
        {
            subnet_name               = "subnet-03"
            subnet_ip                 = "10.10.30.0/24"
            subnet_region             = "europe-west1"
            subnet_flow_logs          = "true"
            subnet_flow_logs_interval = "INTERVAL_10_MIN"
            subnet_flow_logs_sampling = 0.7
            subnet_flow_logs_metadata = "INCLUDE_ALL_METADATA"
        }
    ]

    secondary_ranges = {
        subnet-01 = [
            {
                range_name    = "subnet-01-secondary-01"
                ip_cidr_range = "192.168.64.0/24"
            },
        ]

        subnet-02 = []
    }
}
```
### Applying

Now that Terraform is setup check that the configuration is valid:

```bash
terraform validate 
```

To get a complete list of the different resources Terraform will create to achieve the state described in the configuration files you just wrote, run :

```bash
terraform plan
```

If the configuration is valid then apply it with:

```bash
terraform apply [-auto-approve]
```

Inspect the output of apply to ensure that what Terraform is going to do what you want, if so then enter `yes` at the prompt.
The infrastructure will then be created, this make take a some time.


### Clean Up

Remove the infrastructure created by Terraform with:

```bash
terraform destroy [-auto-approve]
rm -rf .terraform
```

Sometimes Terraform may report a failure to destroy some resources due to dependencies and timing contention.
In this case wait a few seconds and run the above command again. If it is still unable to remove everything it may be necessary to remove resources manually using the `gcloud` command or the Cloud Console.

The GCS Bucket used for Terraform state storage can be removed with:

```bash
gsutil rm -r gs://[BUCKET]
```
